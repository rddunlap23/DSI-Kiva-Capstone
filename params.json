Borrowers apply to a local Field Partner, which manages the loan on the ground. \r\n\r\n2. Partner loans are facilitated by local nonprofits or lending institutions, which approve the borrower’s loan request. Kiva does due diligence and ongoing monitoring for each of these Field Partners.\r\n\r\n3. Disbursal refers to when the borrower can access the money— the timing of this can vary. For most Field Partner loans, the money is pre-disbursed, so the borrower can access the funds right away. \r\n\r\n4. Depending on the type of loan, a Field Partner or borrower uploads the loan details into the \r\nsystem. Our worldwide network of volunteers then helps to edit and translate loans before they go live on the website for lenders to crowdfund.\r\n\r\n5. Lenders receive repayments over time, based on the given repayment schedule and the borrower’s ability to repay. The repayments go into the lenders’ Kiva accounts.\r\n\r\n6. Lenders use repayments to fund new loans, donate or withdraw the money.\r\n\r\n## Business Problem:\r\n\r\nIn 2012 Kiva instituted a 30 day period for a loan to be crowd-funded on the site. If after 30 days the loan is not fully funded the loan is flagged as expired and any money raised is returned to the lenders. Per Kiva's [blog post](https://www.kiva.org/blog/kiva/2012/08/13/qa-expiring-loans-credit-limits-and-the-evolution-of-kiva.html) this was done for primarily two reasons:\r\n\r\n* So that posted loans reflect the reality on the ground. If a loan is on the site for too long a borrower could already be paying back the loan. \r\n* To help provide a feedback loop for field partners. Having loans expired lets the field partner know that they are not posting loans that are desired by lenders on the site. \r\n\r\nIt is in both Kiva and the field partners best interest for loans to be funded. Kiva is acting on it's mission when it is helping to facilitate loans to those that need them most. This can only be done if the loan is fully funded and the capital is disbursed. Having everyone's money tied up in half funded loans provides know actual capital. Loan partners need to free up captital as well... need to flush this section out better.  ",

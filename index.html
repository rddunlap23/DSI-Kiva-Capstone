<p><a href="https://www.kiva.org/about/how">Kiva Loan Lifecycle</a></p>

<p>The life of a loan generally follows the following lifecycle:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Borrowers apply to a local Field Partner, which manages the loan on the ground. </p></li>
<li><p>Partner loans are facilitated by local nonprofits or lending institutions, which approve the borrower’s loan request. Kiva does due diligence and ongoing monitoring for each of these Field Partners.</p></li>
<li><p>Disbursal refers to when the borrower can access the money— the timing of this can vary. For most Field Partner loans, the money is pre-disbursed, so the borrower can access the funds right away. </p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the type of loan, a Field Partner or borrower uploads the loan details into the 
system. Our worldwide network of volunteers then helps to edit and translate loans before they go live on the website for lenders to crowdfund.</p></li>
<li><p>Lenders receive repayments over time, based on the given repayment schedule and the borrower’s ability to repay. The repayments go into the lenders’ Kiva accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Lenders use repayments to fund new loans, donate or withdraw the money.</p></li>
</ol>

<a id="business-problem" class="anchor" href="#business-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Business Problem:</h2>

<p>In 2012 Kiva instituted a policy where a loan has 30 days to be crowd-funded on the site before it expires. If after 30 days the loan is not fully funded the loan is flagged as expired and any money raised is returned to the lenders. If this happens the loan and the risk is beared by the loan partner. Per <a href="https://www.kiva.org/blog/kiva/2012/08/13/qa-expiring-loans-credit-limits-and-the-evolution-of-kiva.html">Kiva's blog post</a> this was done for primarily two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>So that posted loans reflect the reality on the ground. If a loan is on the site for too long a borrower could already be paying back the loan. </li>
<li>To help provide a feedback loop for field partners. If a field partner's loans are expiring that is a signal to them that they are not posting loans that are in demand by lenders on the site.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Kiva's mission is to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. To maximize their impact they want to ensure that they are helping to efficiently deploy users capital to as many aspiring entrepreneurs across the globe as possible. If Kiva can decrease the number of loans that go unfunded it will help them to reach more entrepreneurs and better execute on their mission to alleviate poverty. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to build a model that will help predict if a loan is at risk of being funded. Armed with this knowledge Kiva can either work to feature these loans more prominently on the sight or work with field partners and borrowers to better present their loans to maximize demand and increase funding. </p>
